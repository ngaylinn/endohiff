Endosymbiotic HIFF

A research project inspired by endosymbiosis. A "host" will provide an
evolved environment for a population of "symbionts." By shaping the fitness
landscape, we hypothesize the host can influence the evolutionary trajectory of
its symbionts and lead them to achieve higher fitness scores than they would in
a non-agential environment.
