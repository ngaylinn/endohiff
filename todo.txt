TODO:
- Audit remaining code for refactors:
  - Maybe have paper / supplemental versions of figures?
  - Generate additional samples where CPPN wins
  - Sweep logs store env_name, but maybe remove it for consistency with other logs?
  - Capitalize 'fitness' in column names.
  - Store trial as an int column, not string?
  - Rewrite copy figures
  - Update Snakefile to re-run everything
- Update README.md
- Update supp.md
  - Add outer fitnes chart
  - Add hiff / migration / skew visualizations
  - Add ratchet sweep visualization
- Rerun everything from scratch to make sure it still works
- Get a code review
