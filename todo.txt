TODO:
- Audit remaining code for refactors:
  - Maybe have paper / supplemental versions of figures?
  - Generate additional samples where CPPN wins
  - Avoid inner / outer language and talk about bit strings / envs?
  - Use consistent formatting for "environment" and "bitstring" everywhere. Are they abbreviated?
  - Rename log files to avoid inner / outer
  - Add mkdirs to every script that generates output.
  - Sweep logs store env_name, but maybe remove it for consistency with other logs?
  - Capitalize 'fitness' in column names.
  - Store trial as an int column, not string?
  - Maybe remove remnants of supporting crossover?
  - Maybe optimize outer_fitness?
  - Update Snakefile to re-run everything
  - Revise all comments and documentation
- Update README.md
- Update supp.md
  - Add outer fitnes chart
  - Add hiff / migration / skew visualizations
  - Add ratchet sweep visualization
- Rerun everything from scratch to make sure it still works
- Get a code review
